		<h1>Surround Sound 8.1: Channel Reference Table</h1>
		<p>This document specifies the presumptions the Newer Audio Editor makes during the process of downsampling Surround Sound 8.1 audio into stereo or mono audio. Fun fact: Many surround sound options have their own ".1" variant, which means that <i>there is a separate channel that is able to hold only bass. One example for that situation is explosions, or deep earthquakes.</i></p>

		<p>If these conventions are not explicitly followed, the audio editor will not refuse to render the audio. Rather, <b>the audio may sound uneven, rough or telepathic.</b> This is not a critical point to consider, but this may be mandatory if you plan the final product (the exported audio) to be immersive.</p>
