		<h1>Surround Sound 8.1: Channel Reference Table</h1>
		<p>This document specifies the presumptions the Newer Audio Editor makes during the process of downsampling Surround Sound 8.1 audio into stereo or mono audio. Fun fact: Many surround sound options have a ".1" variant, which means that <i>there is a separate channel that stores bassy audio, which is typically played in subwoofer speakers.</i> This is useful for making sounds like explosions or earthquakes more immersive or realistic.</p>

		<p>If these conventions are not explicitly followed, the audio editor will not refuse to render the audio. Instead, <b>the rendered audio may be uneven, rough or telepathic.</b> This is inconvenient — and could also be troublesome — for users who wish to preserve the original environment of the original track.</p>
		<a>This is not a critical point to consider, but this may be mandatory if you plan the final product (the exported audio) to be immersive.</a>
